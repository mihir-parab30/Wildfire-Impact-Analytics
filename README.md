# 🔥 BlazeToxicity: Impact of U.S. Wildfires on Air Quality and Public Health

## 🧠 Abstract

Wildfires in the United States have surged in both frequency and severity over the past two decades due to climate change, land-use changes, and human activities. These events emit vast quantities of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and toxic gases (CO, NO₂, O₃), significantly degrading air quality and exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular health conditions. 

This project investigates the long-term environmental and public health implications of wildfire activity across the U.S. from 2000 to 2022. Through the integration of two large-scale datasets — wildfire incidents and air quality measurements — we identify temporal spikes, regional danger zones, and statistically significant correlations between wildfire frequency and AQI deterioration. Visualized using Flourish Studio, our findings offer actionable insights for public health planning and environmental policy.
